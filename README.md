# formfactories gateway

This server connects local devices on the network to your configured [formfactories](https://formfactories.com) account, allowing you to remotely monitor, control, and schedule your machines.

## Usage

* Download the app for your system from the [latest release](https://github.com/Vivalize/formfactories-gateway-gui/releases/latest).

* Add your formfactories API Key, and press **Start**

* For Windows/Linux, keep the window open (or minimized) to prevent the server from shutting down.

* It's recommended to set this app to open on login (if an API Key is set, it will start automatically).
